## What do I need for this project?

Some kind of data structure for the board? What did I use for other similar games, like tictactoe, would a different data structure be more appropriate for this?
Maybe a graph? Probably a graph

I need gameboard to be reusable since I'll need one for each player.

## Player logic:

What does this module do?
It allows players to take turns playing:
-Could "prompt" players or "listen" for coordinates input.
-Surely should hold computer player logic:

- Should keep track of moves made as to not make the same moves again.
- Picks a random tile from the board, that isn't in the list of alredy made moves
